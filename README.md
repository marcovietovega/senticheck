## Project Structure

- **connectors**: Contains modules for fetching data from external sources (only Bluesky for now).
- **models**: Includes database-related operations and connection management.
- **scripts**: Contains utility scripts like text cleaning.
- **dags**: Placeholder for Airflow DAGs for pipeline automation.
